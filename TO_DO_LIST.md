1. Get deployment to start manually  
2. Orchetsrate deployment   
3. REST API/interface for the end-users - create  (Use orchestration part from step 2) 
5. REST API/interface for the end-users - decommision (Write scrip with command to terminate instances, executed when called for)  
6. REST API/interface for the end-users - resize (horozontal scaling, add more workers)  
                                                  vertical scaling ( Done, only written about it in report)                                                       
8. Efficient deployment scheme (Not important? How do we do it??)  
9. Interface to insert data files. 


What are one able to do from inteface? 
- deploy orchetstration 
- decomission all active instances
- add more workers
- insert datafiles
